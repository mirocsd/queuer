# Media Queue
Simple application with a qt5 GUI for tracking different forms of media.

The queue format is meant to discourage spending more time saving things to to-watch/read/listen lists, than actually watching/reading/listening. For example, occasionally when I scroll through my Spotify library to look at albums I've saved in the past, I will see a bunch in a row that I don't recognize or recall listening to. This happens because Spotify's library shows the last-added album first, which makes sense for it's purpose, but can make it easy to forget about music I wanted to listen to.

The application is very ugly as of right now.
