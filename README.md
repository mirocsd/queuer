# Media Queue
Simple application with a QT5 GUI for tracking different forms of media.

The queue format is meant to discourage spending more time saving things to to-watch/read/listen lists, than actually watching/reading/listening. For example, occasionally when I scroll through my Spotify library to look at albums I've saved in the past, I will see a bunch in a row that I don't recognize or recall listening to. This happens because Spotify's library shows the last-added album first, which makes sense for it's purpose, but can make it easy to forget about music I wanted to listen to.

The application is very ugly as of right now.
The UI is designed using QTDesigner (the myui.ui XML file is autogenerated by QTDesigner)
Uses the sqlite3 python module to create/use a SQLite database for storing the queues remotely.

Future:
- Connect input boxes to APIs that allow for searching for albums/books/movies
